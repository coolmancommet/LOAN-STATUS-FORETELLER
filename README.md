# LOAN STATUS FORETELLER
The aim of this project is to predict whether the applicantâ€™s loan will get approved or not and the maximum loan amount the applicant can apply for using a trained machine learning model

What this loan status foreteller does is that it takes your information as a input to its trained machine learning model .Now after that it will forecast an output on the basis of the training data it took,whether you are eligible for this loan or not. It will tell you the maximum loan that bank can approve depending on information given.
so saving the precious time of their customer by saving all the hectic running around in banks for loan approval status (whether your loan will get approved or not).
